Topics covered include:
- collecting and importing data
- cleaning, preparing & formatting data
- data frame manipulation
- summarizing data
- building machine learning regression models
- model refinement
- creating data pipelines

In this course you will see  how to import data from multiple sources, clean and wrangle data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and create meaningful data visualizations.
